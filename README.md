# pi.dash
A single Web App for Raspberry Pi with basic device information, reboot/shutdown buttons, a command line terminal and provision of integrating other web services.

This started as a pet project developed for my own pesonal use.
Recently I bought a Pi, setup it up as headless and configured it for services like media server, torrents, nas etc. with helpful links avaialable on the internet. 
And this was the first time I had used Linux regularly.
So, there were multiple services that I started using on regular basis in addition to connecting to the device via SSH to check disk space, temperatur etc. 
And it was not very convinient using different applications and URLs to use these services. 
So, this idea developed of having a single platform where I could access all these whether from my desktop PC, or laptop or smart phone.
